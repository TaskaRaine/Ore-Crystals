## Ore Crystals

What's that faint glow in the distance...? Is it a way out of this cave? Is it something more sinister? 

No. It's strange, crystallized metal growing from this ore... Huh. Maybe those temporal storms we've been having have something to do with it?

Deep down in the depths of the world there are many temporal mysteries. A semi-sentient creature enthroned upon a structure of crystal is one such mysteries. It seems to burst with energy, enriching the local cluster of crystals with new life, causing them to rapidly grow an an unnatural rate. They even seem to have taken over the machinery of the depths, the locusts, infesting them with crystal and somehow influenced them to be their guardians.

It may be dangerous, but perhaps...these 'hearts', and these crystals... will they be useful, in some way?

### Changelog

#### Version 1.3.7
Ore Crystals is now compatible with Vintage Story 1.17.0+

Crystals should now once again spawn under water. With the new water physics update in vanilla, they should be able to share space with water blocks.

Recipes have been implemented to craft crystallized ore items. These recipes are based off of recipes provided by Kagranack on Discord.

Luminous rods can be broken down into crystal shards. This recipe was provided by Kagranack on Discord.

#### Version 1.3.6
Fixed an issue that would cause the server to hang.

Ore Crystals should now be much more resiliant in such cases where mods add new ores. There is no compatibility for these ores, but steps have been taken to reduce potential issues that could arise.

All 'remove' patches have been replaced with 'move' patches to prevent mod compatibility issues.

The break chance for crystal arrows has been increased. They're powerful, but should often break.

#### Version 1.3.5
Compatability patch for Vintage Story 1.16

#### Version 1.3.4
Fixed a rare crash that occurred with the obelisk heart spawner 

Fixed a crash caused by crystals being broken with a nearly destroyed tool.

Breaking obelisk blocks will now appropriately damage both pickaxes and chisels.

With passive/never hostile mode active, crystal locusts will no longer attack the player. In passive mode, Hearts will still get angry when attacked. Not in never aggressive.

Only one spawner exists per obelisk block now. This should prevent hearts from 'doubling up' on occassion.

Quartz crystal seeds can now be crafted.


#### Version 1.3.2
Increased stack size of Crystal Hearts to 8.

Increased stack size of Crystal Grenades to 8.

Added better detailed death messages for heart/locust/grenade deaths.

Created a placeholder crystal planter that is the sole craftable planter. It better explains the crafting process for the variant blocks as a nondescript crystal planter.

Fixed an issue where crystal planters were not craftable.

Fixed an issue where obelisks could not be broken with chisels.


#### Version 1.3.1
Fixed an issue where a patch to the arrow caused all vanilla game arrows to be removed from the creative inventory/handbook 


#### Version 1.3.0
Major update to Ore Crystals which features new harvesting and crystal farming mechanics, along with new blocks and items!

##### Major Changes
Crystals of any varienty can now only be harvested by using a chisel or pickaxe. Chisel harvesting yields more crystal.

Only crystal seeds can be crafted. All other variants are not craftable. 

##### New Things

Added a multiblock obelisk structure to the worldgen that will spawn once in each chunk if 2x2 ore blocks have an upper face open to air. 

Obelisks spawn a new entity whenever a player nears called a Crystal Heart. It is guarded by three Crystal Locusts, a new locust variant, with a new AI behaviour. It will charge at the nearest player whenever its health drops below a threshold and embed itself in the ground before exploding into shards of crystal.

Cores can be carved from hearts using a knife and crafted into different variants of heart.

Crystal Seeds can now be crafted by the player, replacing all other previously craftable crystals. They are used in conjunction with Crystal Hearts to grow crystal.

Crystal Arrows can be crafted with the rare Luminous Rod. They can be used to light up a dark cave from a distance, or as a normal arrow. 

Planter Crystal decorations. Ore placed within a planter and surrounded by crystal, a much larger variant of the potted crystal.

Crystal Grenades. Take your favourite crystal heart, shove a whole bunch of crystal shards into it, and watch it deal massive amounts of damage as it explodes into tiny shards of crystal. 

#### Version 1.2.2
Minor worldgen tweak that prevents crystals from stealing spaces in the new underwater lakes for VS 1.14.3.

#### Version 1.2.1
Mod objects are now better organized within the handbook.

#### Version 1.2.0
Ore crystal textures have been updated.

Ore crystals now act as a faint light source and have been given a reflective shader. These changes are only visible on newly generated crystals.

Ore crystals now have a chance to drop a new item called Crystal Shards. 

All variations of ore crystals can now be crafted with shards and placed in world.

Crystalline Glass has been added, a frosty stained glass block for each crystal variant.

Potted Crystals have been added.

#### Version 1.1.4
Mod updated to be compatible with Vintage Story 1.13

#### Version 1.1.3
Ore Crystals is now being released as DLL mod which should solve the error where VSSurvival could not be found as a dependency when the mod is loaded on a dedicated server.

#### Version 1.1.2
Implemented the '/cleanworld' command. This can be used to revert the ? blocks that the mod created due to incorrect crystal IDs. 

#### Version 1.1.1
Fixed an issue where incorrect crystal IDs were used during world generation when the mod was added to existing worlds.

#### Version 1.1.0
Increased texture opacity of crystals to make them slightly more visible

#### Version 1.0.0
Initial Release
