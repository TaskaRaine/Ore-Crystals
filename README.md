## Ore Crystals

What's that faint glow in the distance...? Is it a way out of this cave? Is it something more sinister? 

No. It's strange, crystallized metal growing from this ore... Huh. Maybe those temporal storms we've been having have something to do with it?

### Description

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Vintage Story mod, Ore Crystals! 

This is a relatively simple quality of life/visual mod that makes cave exploring a little more exciting and makes those ores a little more noticable!

This mod adds crystals to the worldgen, growing out the sides of any vanilla ore blocks with a surface open to air. They are fragile structures that have a chance to break into shards which can then be used to craft various crystal-based blocks.
